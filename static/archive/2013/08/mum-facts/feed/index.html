		<description><![CDATA[Band going up first has NEVER won (woodland) 

Band going up second has NEVER won (Fralinger)

Gold Miner theme has NEVER won (Quaker)

Avalon has NEVER won

Ferko has NEVER won when finishing 5th or worse the previous year

Patriotic(GK), Pirates(SPSB), and Space(Aqua)  have each won 3 times in the past, which is more than the other themes being performed this year.

Since wheels were permitted on props (2004): 

              The only bands to win are Fralinger, Quaker City and Woodland

              Quaker City is the only band to finish in the top 3 every year. 

              no band that finished 2nd the previous year has won. (Quaker)

              the average position that has won is 16th (15.6) which this year is Greater Kensington. 

Put your money on GK this year!]]></description>
