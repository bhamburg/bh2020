		<description><![CDATA[Doteasy engages in illegal billing and business practices. They will charge your cancelled account without consent. They do not follow ICANN policies be warned. I worked there, and I was DISGUSTED at how I had to lie to customers and basically make excuses on why we cannot transfer their domain name.

If a customer changes their contact information on the domain, they cannot transfer the domain away from Doteasy until after 60 days. So basically, you are FORCED to renew with Doteasy. If you want to transfer your domain name before expiry, they will keep the ball rolling until it expires, and then tell you it has expired, so you cant transfer it and you are required to renew, which is a 60 day lock. 

If you attempt to dispute charges via your bank. They WILL charge you a hosting chargeback fee.

Be warned and stay the hell away from Doteasy / In2Net / Dollarhost (they are all the same company).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been using Doteasy for over 10 years now and have only had a couple of issues during email upgrades. I do not use Doteasy as my domain registrar, I simply paid the one time $35 setup fee and have not had any additional charges. Although their support is via email only, the turn around time has generally been within 24 hours. I would never use Doteasy as a domain registrar, there are many others less exspensive. But so far, it hasn&#039;t mattered who the registrar was, NONE of them want you to transfer from them and all of them take DAYS to unlock your domain. Buy your domain from somewhere else, but you will be hard pressed to beat Doteasy in the hosting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the mail I received a letter that I thought was legitimate asking me to renew my domain with Doteasy. It turns out I was targeted by a company known as DROC (domain registry of Canada). I was almost tricked by DROC into transferring my domain name to them!

When I contacted Doteasy, thank goodness they took the time to ask me why I wanted to transfer my domain name away from them, otherwise I would have ended up getting scammed by the DROC.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hey

yes Doteasy sucks, but it will be even worse the day you try to transfer away from Godaddy...  they have such a convoluted and obscure hidden system for recurring charges and keeping your account active that as far as I can see, it&#039;s not possible to EVER close your account with Godaddy.   

Just try and find the &quot;close account&quot; page on godaddy.com, I dare you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We agree Doteasy SUCKS, as I type this we are on the phone with Godaddy, because Doteasy won&#039;t release our email, We transfered to GoDaddy back in Jan and are stll having problems with Doteasy. 

This company preys on People who don&#039;t know much about websites and uses this power to suck you in and then unless you have someone who really knows what they are doing you can&#039;t get out.

Thank God for GoDaddy, They will have our problem fixed soon and then hoepfully we will be done with DotEasy forever]]></description>
